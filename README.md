CASE STUDY:: HEART DISEASE PREDICTION
Background
Peterside Hospital is a private hospital with a lot of patients from both genders and of all ages. It is located in Nigeria and has a major challenge dimacating features of heart problems and the possible cause of it. Heart disease is a major health issue that can occur in people of any age. Although Peterside hospital is ranked high, it has to update its healthcheck technology if it must remian in the market with average or above average competitive power.

Objective
The objective of this case study is to help Peterside hospital, a private hospital, develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the presence of heart problems in patients based on its features, such chest_pain_type, resting_blood_pressure, cholesterol, fasting_blood_sugar etc.

Data
The data used in this case study is a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, which contains information on patients registered in a hospital, including their health check-up readings such as, cholesterol, heart pressure, blood sugar and others. The dataset contains over 303 records and 14 variables/features.

Methodology
The methodology used in this case study involves the following steps:

Data cleaning and preprocessing: The first step is to clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values, removing outliers, and transforming variables as necessary.

Exploratory data analysis: Next, we will perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data, such as identifying trends and patterns, and identifying correlations between variables.

Feature engineering: Based on the insights gained from the exploratory data analysis, we will perform feature engineering to select the most relevant features for predicting heart disease and transform them as necessary.

Model selection and training: We will then select a suitable machine learning algorithm for predicting heart diseases, such as logistic regression, a decision tree, and other model will be trained on the preprocessed data.

Model evaluation and fine-tuning: We will evaluate the performance of each model using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall score and others.

The best model will be selected and recmmended for use.
